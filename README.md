This is "JJ Shep", my alt account. My main account is Elusive_ZDT, but I don't have a Github account in that name.

I often fantasize about a fictional organization called The Advance that would be like the United Nations, but independent and more powerful. It would have hundreds of subsidiary companies, with names that don't mean anything (like "Sheffield Compact", "Epsilon Converse" and "Blazefold Solutions").

Main username/hostname: zhoudt@Advance

Iâ€™m interested in: Linux (mainly Arch and Gentoo)
